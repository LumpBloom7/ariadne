\brief Tutorial on %Ariadne's features for rigorous numerics and computable analysis.

\page rigorous_numerics_tutorial_page Tutorial on Rigorous Numerics and Computable Analysis

In this tutorial, we show how to use %Ariadne to perform rigorous computations on numbers, sets and functions,
based on theoretical principles from computable analysis.
